## [Description](/Data-Structure.py)

* Maze Definition: A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal.

* A people starts at a position (source) and can move in four directions, the goal is to reach the destination:
  * Up
  * Down
  * Left
  * Right

* Direction Priority:  Right, Left, Up, Down <br>

## [Design](/Data-Structure.py)

> Key point: thinking find the path between two point in a graph.

* Step 1: Study the picture below until you understand how a maze can be converted into a graph.

* Step 2: Use DFS to find the path between two position.
